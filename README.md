Kashela

Your Hustle. Your Money. One App.

Kashela is a revolutionary AI-powered financial assistant built for Africa's informal traders, small shopkeepers, and mobile hustlers. With just a voice command or a snapshot, Kashela helps users track income and expenses in real-time, calculate profit/loss, and accept digital payments via M-PESA, Bank, and QR Codes.

🌍 Purpose

Kashela was born during the Vibe Coding Hackathon — part of the #1MillionDevs Movement — to solve real-world problems using AI and low-code tools.

We're answering the Retail & Ecommerce challenge:

"Many small traders don’t track their income or expenses and have no idea if they’re making a profit."

Kashela empowers them to know where their money goes — instantly.
